<p>
The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the critical need for accurate forecasting models to understand and predict the spread of the virus. 
This project aims to develop and evaluate machine learning models for COVID-19 forecasting in the United States and compare their performance with models 
submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The objective is to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of pandemic prediction and 
support informed decision-making.

Social media has reshaped communication in the last decade, supporting interactionand community development among participants who would never otherwisemeet. It provides opportunities to users for sharing 
	information and expressingtheir opinions on specific topics. Recent studies show that social media is immenselyinstrumental in changing, and measuring public opinions on particularissues. 
	These open platforms bring the freedom to users to disseminate informationfor changing the public opinion and the normative behaviors of users throughimplementing a persuasive discourse on 
	certain topics. While some accounts chooseto share promotional information about their products to influence the public opinion,some other malicious-intended accounts share misinformation or 
	propagandato persuade others. In this research, we use marijuana and radicalization relatedcommunications as focal cases, employing a context-aware and knowledge-drivenapproach for modeling the 
	persona in these persuasive discussions on social media.

Formalized knowledge engineering activities including semantic annotation and linked data management tasks in specialized domains suffer from considerable knowledge acquisition bottleneck - owing to the lack of availability 
	of experts and in-efficacy of automated approaches. Human Computation & Crowdsourcing (HC&C) methods successfully advocate leveraging the human intelligence and processing power to solve problems that are still difficult 
	to be solved computationally. Contextualized to the domain of Islamic Knowledge, this research investigates the synergistic interplay of these HC&C methods and the semantic web and proposes a semantics driven human-machine 
	computation framework for knowledge engineering in specialized and knowledge intensive domains. The overall objective is to augment the process of automated knowledge extraction and text mining methods using a hybrid 
	approach for combining collective intelligence of the crowds with that of experts to facilitate activities in formalized knowledge engineering - thus overcoming the so-called knowledge acquisition bottleneck. As part 
	of this framework, we design and implement formal and scalable knowledge acquisition workflows through the application of semantics driven crowdsourcing methodology and its specialized derivative, called learnersourcing.  
	We evaluate these methods and workflows for a range of knowledge engineering tasks including thematic classification, thematic disambiguation, thematic annotation and contextual interlinking for two primary Islamic texts, 
	namely the Qur'an and the books of Prophetic narrations called the Hadith. This is done at various levels of granularity, including atomic and composite task workflows, that existing research fails to address. We leverage 
	primarily upon students and learners engaging in typical knowledge seeking and learning scenarios. The chosen method ensures annotation reliability by introducing an 'expert sourcing' workflow tightly integrated within 
	the system. Therefore, quantitative measures of ensuring annotation quality are woven into the very fabric of the human computation framework. The results of our evaluation demonstrate that our proposed methods are robust 
	and are capable of generating high quality and reliable annotations, while significantly reducing the need for expert contributions.

As more data is being semantically annotated, it is getting more common that researchers in multiple disciplines to rely on semantic repositories that contain large amounts of data in the form of ontologies 
as a compact source of information. One of the main issues currently facing these researchers is the lack of easy-to-use interfaces for data retrieval, due to the need to use special query languages or applications. 
In addition, the knowledge in these repositories might not be comprehensive or up-to-date due to several reasons, such as the discovery of new knowledge in the field after the repositories was created. In this 
dissertation, we present our SemanticQA system that allows users to query semantic data repositories using natural language questions. If a user question cannot be answered solely from the ontology, SemanticQA 
detects the failing parts and attempts to answer these parts from web documents and plugs in the answers to answer the whole questions, which might involve a repetition of the same process if other parts fail.
At the same time, with the large number of ontologies being added constantly, it is difficult for users to find ontologies that are suitable to their work. Therefore, tools for evaluating and ranking the ontologies 
are needed. For this purpose, we present OntoQA, a tool that evaluates ontologies related to a certain set of terms and then ranks them according a set of metrics that captures different aspects of ontologies. 
Since there are no global criteria defining how a good ontology should be, OntoQA allows users to tune the ranking towards certain features of ontologies to suit the need of their applications. OntoQA is not 
only useful for users trying to find suitable ontologies, but for ontology developers who are looking for measures to evaluate their product.

In todays web search technologies, the link structure of the web plays a critical role. In this work, the goal is to use semantic relationships for ranking documents without relying on the existence of any specific 
	    structure in a document or links between documents. Instead, named/real-world entities are identified and the relevance of documents is determined using relationships that are known to exist between 
	    the entities in a populated ontology, that is, by connecting-the-dots. We introduce a measure of relevance that is based on traversal and the semantics of relationships that link entities in an ontology. 
	    The implementation of the methods described here builds upon an existing architecture for processing unstructured information that solves some of the scalability aspects for text processing, indexing and 
	    basic keyword/entity document retrieval. The contributions of this thesis are in demonstrating the role and benefits of using relationships for ranking documents when a user types a traditional keyword query. 
	    The research components that make this possible are as follows. First, a flexible semantic discovery and ranking component takes user-defined criteria for identification of the most interesting semantic 
	    associations between entities in an ontology. Second, semantic analytics techniques substantiate feasibility of the discovery of relevant associations between entities in an ontology of large scale such as 
	    that resulting from integrating a collaboration network with a social network (i.e., for a total of over 3 million entities). In particular, one technique is introduced to measure relevance of the nearest 
	    or neighboring entities to a particular entity from a populated ontology. Last, the relevance of documents is determined based on the underlying concept of exploiting semantic relationships among entities 
	    in the context of a populated ontology. Our research involves new capabilities in combining the relevance measure techniques along with using or adapting earlier capabilities of semantic metadata extraction, 
	    semantic annotation, practical domain-specific ontology creation, fast main-memory query processing of semantic associations, and document-indexing capabilities that include keyword and annotation-based document 
	    retrieval. We expect that the semantic relationship-based ranking approach will be either an alternative or a complement to widely deployed document search for finding highly relevant documents that traditional 
	    syntactic and statistical techniques cannot find.
